## 🧩 Notes

This **Single Page Application (SPA)** portfolio was built using **React + Vite** and optimized for performance, scalability, and accessibility.  
It reflects my front-end engineering principles — clean component architecture, responsive layout, and modern UI patterns.

The previous **Multi-Page Application (MPA)** portfolio remains archived on GitHub as a version history reference.  
This SPA serves as the most advanced, recruiter-ready version of my portfolio to date.
