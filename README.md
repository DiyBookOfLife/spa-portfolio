## 🧩 Notes

This portfolio reflects my current front-end engineering abilities — built with **React** and **Vite**, styled with modern **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, and custom responsive layouts. It’s designed for performance, accessibility, and a clean user experience across all devices.

Key highlights include:

- Custom **React hooks** for scroll tracking and active-section detection
- **Framer Motion** animations for smooth, modern UI transitions
- A modular, component-driven architecture focused on scalability
- Strong attention to accessibility and responsive design principles

This version replaces my earlier multi-page React portfolio, marking my transition toward a more dynamic, client-rendered architecture. It represents my ongoing focus as a **Front-End Software Engineer** — building interactive, maintainable, and accessible web applications with clarity and precision.
